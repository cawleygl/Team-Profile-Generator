# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description of Application
This application generates an html file containing profiles for members on a software engineering team. It utilized npm inquirer to gather data about each team member from the user and prints them to the file in a meaningful and appealing way. Teams can consist of one manager and any number of engineers and interns. All team members are given a unique id and have their email addresses displayed with a clickable link. Additionally, the team manager has their office number displayed, engineers have their GitHub profiles linked, and interns have their universities displayed. Along with npm inquirer, this application uses node.js to initialize through the terminal, and was created using jest to initiate tests along the way.
